### Auzen

*About Auzen*
Auzen is a decentralized data storage and management platform designed to give users full control over their digital assets. 
Built on Swarm and Ethereum, it enables secure, censorship-resistant, and on-chain storage, allowing individuals and organizations to store,
organize, share, and monetize their data without relying on centralized platforms.

Tired of having your personal data stolen, exploited, or put at risk by centralized platforms? Auzen is here to change that! Store your data securely on a decentralized network, control who accesses it, and monetize it on your terms. Share with ZK-verified companies while ensuring authenticity and security. Contribute without fear—your input is immutable and protected.

## Goals
In a world where personal data is constantly exploited, leaked, or controlled by corporations, Auzen puts power back into the hands of users. 
By leveraging decentralized storage, cryptographic security, and smart contract-based permissions, Auzen ensures that data remains secure, private, and fully owned by its creators—no third parties involved.
Auzen's goal is to onboard users on web3 while keeping their data secured.
